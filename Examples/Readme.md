# Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing

## 🔹 Overview  
This project implements **Seam Carving**, an advanced image resizing technique that removes pixels **intelligently** to reduce the width and height while preserving important content.

### ✅ Supports Three Resizing Cases:
1️⃣ **Reducing both Width & Height**  
2️⃣ **Reducing only Height**  
3️⃣ **Reducing only Width**

## 🖼️ Examples of Seam Carving  

### **1️⃣ Reducing Both Width & Height**
- **Original image is resized**, maintaining key features.
- Visualization shows removed seams in **red**.

📌 **Seams Visualization:**

📌 **Final Resized Image:**

### **2️⃣ Reducing Only Height**
- **Only height is reduced**, width remains unchanged.
- Seam carving removes **horizontal seams**.

### **3️⃣ Reducing Only Width**
- **Only width is reduced**, height remains unchanged.
- Seam carving removes **vertical seams**.
